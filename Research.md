Origin: English slang. To travel purposefully towards a vague destination.

App to find the right people for the next adventure trip on your journey. 

You can create a trip and invite others to join your adventure. Adventures are created by sharing a certain interest with like minded people. 
You go on this trip together and from there everything can happen. Find new soulmates, learn more about your hobby or profession, take the next step to ninja skills.

## Prototype

* Trip to Western Greece, work and travel with web developers and digital nomads from around the world, share projects and collaborate like coworking in the sun.
* Trip to Crete Island, app development projects including childcare.

During the prototypes we will search for places to travel safely avoiding corona risk areas. Places will be updated if situation changes. https://reopen.europa.eu/en
